    <h2 class="other">Dolphin diet</h2>
    <p class="oth2">Dolphins are friendly creatures that live all over the world. Their diet is varied, consisting of squid, shrimps, jellyfish and octopuses. The types of fish and other creatures dolphins eat depend on the species of dolphin, where the dolphins live and the wildlife that shares their habitats.</p>
    <p class="oth2">Bottlenose dolphins, for example, are one of the best known dolphins in the world. They live in temperate and topical waters, and are commonly studied and observed by scientists. These bottlenose dolphins are not endangered for now, but are still protected under the Endangered Species Act ESA. It is important for humans to work together to preserve these species.</p>
